Requirements:
1) Boost library
2) dmidecode binary

Building:
1) First build boost
  - cd <boost_dir>
  - > ./bootstrap.sh
  - > ./bjam
  - It takes a while. Get coffee
2) Build dmidecode (You can do this while boost is building)
  - > cd <code>/dmidecode
  - > make
3) Edit makefile and build agent (Wait for boost to finish building before attempting)
  - Open makefile and change the line
    BOOST_DIR=/data/boost_1_44_0
    to point to where you extracted boost
  - > make

Running:
1) > ./agent -h
2) Hopefully the options are self explanatory
