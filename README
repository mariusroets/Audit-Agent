Requirements:
1) Boost library
2) dmidecode binary

Building:
1) First build boost
  - cd <boost_dir>
  - > ./bootstrap.sh
  - > ./bjam
  - It takes a while. Get coffee
2) Build dmidecode (You can do this while boost is building)
  - > cd <code>/dmidecode
  - > make
3) Build libgeneral
  - > cd <code>/libgeneral
  - > make
4) Build ftplib
  - > cd <code>/ftplib
  - > make
5) Edit makefile and build agent (Wait for boost to finish building before attempting)
  - Open makefile and change the line
    BOOST_DIR=/data/boost_1_44_0
    to point to where you extracted boost
  - > make

Running:
1) > ./agent -h
2) Hopefully the options are self explanatory

Deploying:
It is possible to do a local or remote deploy. In both cases, deploy must be done from the deploy directory. If the remote machine does not have ssh available, or it is not possible to ssh to the root user, then copy the deploy directory to the remote machine, and do a local deploy there.
Local:
1) cd to deploy directory
2) > ./deploy_tarball.sh
3) This needs to be run as root
Remote:
1) cd to deploy directory
2) > ./deploy_tarball.sh 127.0.0.1
3) This will require the root password on the remote machine
